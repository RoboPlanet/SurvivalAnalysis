# SurvivalAnalysis

This jupyter notebook contains an example of fitting Kaplain-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards models to telco churn dataset using lifelines Python package. I am also using scikit-survival to calculate C-index IPCW (Uno concordance) and AUC. Brier score is calculated using a function from scikit-learn.
